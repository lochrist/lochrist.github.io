Great post by [Randy Gaul](https://twitter.com/RandyPGaul) on [Why write a game engine in 2017](http://www.randygaul.net/2017/02/24/writing-a-game-engine-in-2017/). Key takeaways are:

- It is fun!
- You control everything: from the debugging, to the specific workflows to the performance.
- Ensure you have an efficient development workflow: hot-reloading, always on philiosphy.

The end of the post is a somewhat controversial stance on *Entity Component System* and how some developers use this as the silver bullet to solve all the problems of the world. This is a great read. You should never blindly apply patterns without understanding why you are using them and what problem you *are really* solving.
