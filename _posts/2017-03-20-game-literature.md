### Early days
Like any good geeks I like to dig deep into geeky subjects. When I started into boardgames, I found all the websites ([bgg](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/), [tric trac](https://www.trictrac.net/), [grognard](https://grognard.com/), [The Gaming Cabinet](http://www.gamecabinet.com/)) I could and started reading EVERYTHING! I subscribed to lots of blogs and I obviously bought lots of games.

### Youtube reviews
These days, Boardgamegeek is as pertinent as ever. But lots of boardgaming information is done through youtube reviews and podcasts. [The Dicetower](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwBbXQlljGjKtKhcdMliRA) creates new content each day. They are really at the forefront of boardgame reviews. Rodney of [Watch it played](https://www.youtube.com/user/WatchItPlayed) is really great as well but mostly explains games rather than review EVERTYHING that comes under the sun. On the other hand [Marco](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqjObEZh6BQw2xpgMjPZ7qg) really reviews everything with a strong focus on obscure games, print and play games and wargames.

Personally I prefer reading to wathing videos. I also tend to prefer a good critic rather than a rule review. [The Tao of Gaming](https://taogaming.wordpress.com/) is a really great blog with some really opiniated reviews, comments and critics. It is sad that it is not updated more often.

### Lifestyle games
Games with lots of expansions and that constantly evolves are the best catalysts for "gaming focus literature". Magic the Gathering is the best case for this. LOTS of websites exist solely to talk about MtG strategies. Even if I play MtG a lot less, I still like to read about the latest news, decks and meta-game changes. My preferred sites for MtG are: [Starcity Games](http://www.starcitygames.com/), [Channel Fireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing), [TCG Game](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/) but especially [MtgGoldfish](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/).

MtgGolfish is great because it both aggregates lots of info about all MtG formats meta-game and also because its main content provider, [SaffronOlive](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/search?author=26), likes to create and try wacky and original [decks](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-zur-an-modern).

### Hearthstone
[Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/) is an hyper popular game that has its own forums and gaming literature. At some point I was up to date with Hearthstone and read [Hearthstone Players](https://hearthstoneplayers.com/), [Hearthhead](http://www.hearthhead.com/) and [Reddit Hearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/).

### Epic (hopefully)
These days I really like the [Epic Cardgame](http://www.epiccardgame.com/). And I would like to have more sources of Epic articles than there are right now! [Boardgameeek Epic focums](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175621/epic-card-game/forums/) has some activty. I really like [Tom's Epic Gaming](http://www.tomsepicgaming.com/). That guy has published some great [content](http://www.tomsepicgaming.com/epic-card-game/) on Epic. Analyzing Epic for its [design choices](http://www.tomsepicgaming.com/epic-5-critical-aspects/) and its [strategic side](http://www.tomsepicgaming.com/category/strategyarticle/).

I lately found this new [Epic strategy blog](http://epicstrategy.blogspot.ca/). I hope that guy continue to write because so far his content is good.

The [Epic Foundry](http://decks.epiccardgame.com/) web site can be used both as a deck builder and it also stores decks that did well at recent tournaments.
