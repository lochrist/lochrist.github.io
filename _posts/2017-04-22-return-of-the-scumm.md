I already [talked](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-04-07-real-game-for-fantasy-console) [twice](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-04-08-fantasy-consoles-war) about the Fantasy console [Pico-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). [Paul Nicholas](https://github.com/Liquidream) really did a great achievement using this fantasy micro-console: he kind of recreated the famous [SCUMM engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM) that was used to power old school classics like Zak McKracken and the Monkey Island games.

It is quite the something to code an ENGINE and some games for this limited console!

You can have a look at the [demo game](http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=29176) and the [source](https://github.com/Liquidream/scumm-8) of the engine. Here are a few images to show you what kind of engine we are talking about:
