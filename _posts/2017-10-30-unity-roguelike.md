I have now left Autodesk (and Stingray) and will be joining [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) real soon. This will be the first time in my career in which I will be able to leverage my knowledge of a field of application into another job. Yeah me!

I [dabbled](https://github.com/lochrist/pitchcrawlUnity) a bit with Unity during the last few years. But I haven't used the editor recently. So during my break in between my new job I started to try some tutorials and see what were the new features added to the editor.

When sampling the different tutorials I found this *AWESOME* [video serie](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-29-roguelike-development) on how to create a [Roguelike](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial) game with procedural level generation and using some cool [pixel art](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-13-pixel-art).

This serie is super well done and covers even how to do UI and Sound!
