### Little boardgaming history
As long as I can remember I have been playing games. [Uno](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2223/uno) with my parents. Then Monopoly, Clue and a slew of other more mainstream games. Some of those were more involve like the 1982 game: [Survive escape from Atlantis](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2653/survive-escape-atlantis). Some were total thrash like the badly design french canadian called Fric which tried to emulate Monopoly without any of the strategies.

At some point, I stumbled upon a French magazine called: [Jeux et strategie](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeux_et_Strat%C3%A9gie). I then began to discover what were the designer games of that time.

Fast forward a few years, I went deep into Dungeon and Dragons. And then Magoc the Gathering. And then all sorts of other collectible card games.

In University all hell broke loose: I discovered [Settles of Catan](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38821/settlers-catan-gallery-edition). And then proceed to buy over the years all the best games on [Boardgame Geek](https://www.boardgamegeek.com).

### What about podcasts?
When podcast just began in early 2000's the 2 founders of boardgame geek created a show called [Geekspeak](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BoardGameSpeak). This was the first podcast I listen to, and it started a whole craze of boardgaming podcasts.

These days I listen mostly to [The Dicetower](http://www.dicetower.com/), [The D6 Generation](http://www.thed6generation.com/) and a few others.

Strange to see how a medium as low key as boardgaming has pioneered the podcast movement (or has it?).

### Present times
These days I still play a lot of games. My boardgame [collection](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/lochrist?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1) is still growing thanks in part to [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/games/tabletop%20games?ref=discovery_overlay). I play both Euro games like [Puerto Rico](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3076/puerto-rico), [Terra Mystica](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677/terra-mystica) and [Agricola](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola). I also play a lot of more confrontational games like [Cry Havoc](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/192457/cry-havoc), [Eclipse](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse) and [Scythe](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786/scythe).

Since I have been gaming for such a long time, I am a bit jaded :) I do not play all the latest Euro games coming from Essen. At some point, when you have played a lot of "Victory point cube pushers" they all seem a bit samey. I tend to like games where the theme is well integrated. And when you feel the mechanics are well connected to how you win. [Power Grid](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid) and [Kemet](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/127023/kemet) are good examples of games with well integrated themes.

These days I really like campaign games like [Imperial Assault](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164153/star-wars-imperial-assault), [Descent](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104162/descent-journeys-dark-second-edition), [Seafal](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148261/seafall) or the newer and super intriguing [Gloomhaven](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven).

### Developers and games
On the different boardgames forums, I noticed that a lot of gamers are working in the tech world. It seems games appeal to the mind of programmers! Why is that?

Contrary to computer games, all the systems of a boardgames need to be explicit. All the rules must be explained up front. In fact this is part of the difficulty of introducing more complex games to "muggle": not everybody is able to stay still for 30min of rules explanation and then to apply what they just listen to (but probably not understood) to win a game.

I feel programmers are appreciating that all the rules are layed out in front of them and that they can do their best to optimize the systems.

### Games and programming
Somes games have a "progamming" theme: the mediocre at best game [Hacker](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1250/hacker) tried to replicate what it was to be a hacker in the 1980's.

Some games use programming as a mechanic:

In Roborally [https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally] you use cards with different moves to progam the movement of a robot.

![roborally](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1549168_md.jpg)

The fact that the cards you receive are random at the beginning of a turn makes it difficult to always do something really clever or useful. But the dynamism of the board and of the different conveyor belts, lasers and pushers make every turn a challenge to progam that robot.

[Mechs and Minion](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209010/mechs-vs-minions) a boargdame by [Riot games](http://www.riotgames.com/) (yes that company is into boardgame as well!) uses the programming element of roborally but adds a campaign to it.

![meches](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3225907_md.jpg)

What is nice is that the "progam" of your robot is created over multiple rounds: you add effectively one new "command" each round. And you still must execute all the other "commands" of your program. Beware if you stuck a "turn right" somewhere because you will be turning right at some point every round!

[Colt Express](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/158899/colt-express) is way lighter but it also uses a progamming mecanism. It is easy at first to deduce where you will be moving, but since some actions your fellow cowboys like a good punch could throw out all of your carefully layed out plan.

### The Quintescence of Programming and Boardgame
In my opinion the best game both about programming and using tech related mechanic is [Netrunner](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1301/netrunner). This master piece was created by Richard Garfield, the same guy who has created both Magic The Gatehring and Roborally! What a resume...

[Android Netrunner](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124742/android-netrunner) is the reedition of that game and is readily available. In that asymetric 2 players game you are either playing a Corporation who hides "agenda" and projects behind ICE (programs protecting your data).

![corp](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120206_md.jpg)

Or you play the Runner who tries to hack the corporation using a slew of home made programs, special hardwares and externa resources.

The gameplay is very different depending if you are Runner or Corporation. And the Cyberpunk theme is litterally dripping!
