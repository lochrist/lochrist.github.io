We are a smallish group of about 30 developers working on Stingray. We have multiple teams spread over Stockholm, Montreal, Paris, San Francisco and Prague. This makes it a bit more complicated to have good communication and synergy.

### How to build a remote team

Last year, when I attended GDC, I had 30 minutes to kill after lunch and decide to go watch this presentation on [Remote Team management](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023288/How-to-Build-a-Remote)? I am glad I went to see it! This studio only hires remote workers for their production. And they got it to work seamlessly. Here are few takeaways from the talk:

- In order to ensure property communication among the development they force all developers to work on the same core hours **regardless of their location** You really have to like Pacific time!
- The artists can work from any time zone since they can't "break the product".
- They use Slack with a bunch of channels. And they have created channels just to *blow off steam*: to talk about their weekend, and their hobbies and post pictures about their favorite food.
- They use Ventrilo with lots of "virtual chat rooms" as well. And they try to talk to each other often. Some chat rooms are *work related*. While others are really for *watercooler discussions*.

Some more mundane and less relevant remarks on that talk:

- Not all good talk are one hour long (this one is only 30 min)!
- The subject seemed a bit boring at first, but the whole gig was really captivating. A good presenter can make anything sounds interesting.

### How is it at Trello?

This [article](http://blog.trello.com/6-mistakes-when-you-work-in-office-but-have-remote-team-members) was posted recently and highlights some of the key rules the Trello team apply to make their "remote collaboration" works. Some key points for me were:

- *Avoid impromptu design meetings and decisions*: it is easy to talk to your co-located colleagues and take a big decision (ex: let's create a global event service). And it is easy to communicate that decisions to the rest of your remote team 2 weeks after the fact with a *Pull Request* without much explanation. And two months down the road someone will reinvent the same *event service* because they didn't know about it in the first place.
- *Use video calls. And ensure everyone has a camera*: I hate remote meetings with a passion. But it seems having meetings with everybody on camera help connecting with remote colleagues and makes communication easier. It also helps humanize those people who comment harshly on pull requests.
