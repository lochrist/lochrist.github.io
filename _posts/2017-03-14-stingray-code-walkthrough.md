I have been working on the [Stingray Game Engine](http://www.autodesk.com/products/stingray/overview) for the past few years. For the small history, at the Origin there was small company called [Bitsquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitsquid). This company founded by Tobias Persson (not the hockey player or the comedian) and [Niklas Frykholm](https://github.com/niklasfrykholm) created a very lean and efficient game engine called [Bitsquid](http://bitsquid.blogspot.ca/) (surprise). This game engine got bought by Autodesk and was rebranded as Stingray.

I joined at some point and start working on the new editor. But this is for another story. The matter at hand is that Tobias and Niklas have decided to leave Stingray to create their own new shiny (and hopfully interactive) thing.

I was really lucky to worked with them for the past few years and I learned tremendously from them. Their wealth of knowledge, of exprience and opinions (especially Tobias) is *almost* infinite.

But before they leave us, they gave us the gift of knowledge:
