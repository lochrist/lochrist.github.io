Recently I played [Oh My Goods](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183840/oh-my-goods) with my boardgame crew. This is a clever card game of resource management spiced up with a bit of push your luck. It also makes use of one mechanics I talked about abundantly: [multi](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-04-02-multi-use-cards) use [cards](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-04-11-multi-use-cards-followup)

What is also fascinating with that game is that it got *patched* recently. Early [critique](https://boardgamegeek.com/video/104622/oh-my-goods/oh-my-goods-review-tom-vasel) of the game didn't like the fact that you set up your "building engine" most of the game but often, it  ends before you have time to use your best (and more costly) building. This limited the game to a "build small buildings quickly" strategy.

The author [Alexander Pfister](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/11767/alexander-pfister) (which is the new rising star of boardgaming) has published a set of [2.0 rules](https://www.mayfairgames.com/gamesupport/oh-my-goods-rules-v20) that modifies the game slightly to allow players to setup a big last turn where they will be able to use all their buildings. This changed the game dramatically and helped add a new layer of strategy.

These kind of patches are super common in the software world, but they are much rarer in boardgaming. What is sad though, is that where computer games are automatically patched by Steam, boardgamers need to be informed enough to know that those rules were updated.

All in all, Oh my goods 2.0 is a great game that is [super cheap](https://www.amazon.com/Oh-My-Goods-Card-Game/dp/B01ABN5NZC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1496283577&sr=8-1&keywords=oh+my+goods) and that deserves to be in any gamer's collection.
