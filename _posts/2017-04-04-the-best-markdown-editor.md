In my first ever blog [post](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-12-setup-a-blog) I said that my only requirements for blog publishing technology/hosting must be that it needed to support [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). At work, we write most of our documentation and wiki posts using that markup language. Up to a few weeks I used to write markdown document either in a plain boring text editor like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or in my Javascript coding IDE [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (with the awful markdown plugin). I also used [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/) a lot which is a good *single document* editor with a preview that works quite well.

But for the blog, I really wanted to have an editor that would support a "project view" of all the posts. And then I discovered that [Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) has a markdown preview built in (invoke it with Ctrl + K, V):

The preview is great. Synchronization between the edited text and the preview works well. And the syntax highlighting is good as well. All that and I also get to work with my new editor of choice and benefit from its wealth of plugins (see our [Stingray Lua debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jschmidt42.stingray-debug) for VsCode!).
