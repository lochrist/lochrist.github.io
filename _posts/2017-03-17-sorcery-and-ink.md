When I was young I read tons of ["Chose your own adventure books"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure). My 2 prefered series were the [Lone Wolf serie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf_(gamebooks)) and the [Sorcery serie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcery!). I liked that in those 2 series you played the the same character and you carried your possession, skills and abilities from book to book.

### Inkle Studio
[Inkle studios](http://www.inklestudios.com/) makers of the superb [80 days](http://www.inklestudios.com/80days/) game has faithfully recreated the whole [Sorcery! serie](http://www.inklestudios.com/sorcery/) and you can experience it on iOs, Android and PC. You move your character on a map:

You battle ennemies using a simple combat system:

And you cast spells (that you better have memorized)

You can even use a nifty gizmo to "go back in time" the previous paragprah to change a (bad) choice you might have made. I tend to abuse this mecanic which makes the book super long to read for me.

### Clairvoyance in books
As a side note, this mecanic reminds me of a good serie of [books](http://benedictjacka.co.uk/alex-verus/us/fated/) by Benedict Jacka. The main protagonist, called Alex Verus, can see in the future and simulate what effects specific choices would have on his faith. He can use his power to crack passwords (just look at enough futures to know which one is the right one), anticipate combat moves and just know exactly what to say in a conversation to get the most out of it. Exactly like what you can do in Sorcery!

### Ink Scripting language
To do their story heavy games, Ink studio created their own "scripting" (as in story telling) language called: [Ink](http://www.inklestudios.com/ink/). This language and all the tools and plugins are [open source](https://github.com/inkle/ink) and can be toyed with.

The [Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky) editor allows you to script and to test your interactive story at the same time.

I like it when companies are confident enough in their product to make their tools open source! Now if only Inkle (or anybody using Ink) could adapt the Lone Wolf serie...
