Lots of new content is created with the web game engine [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) each week. The [News feed](http://phaser.io/news) is full of tutorials, full fledge games and plugins.

There are two content creators that have produced some really amazing stuff for Phaser.

### Emanuele Feronato

[Emanuele](@triqui) is a prolific game programmer, designer and tutorial provider. [Emanuele's website](http://www.emanueleferonato.com) contains an incredible number of posts on all kinds of *PROgramming* subjects: Game Design, Javascript, HTML5, Phaser and even Flash!

I really like its HTML5 [content](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/category/phaser/) where a lot of different genres of games are explained, and have Phaser implementation showcased. The series on Sokoban and [Bejeweled](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/tag/bejeweled/) are well worth a look.

As a super [fan](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-29-roguelike-development) of Roguelike games, I deeply appreciated the series of posts on [how to calculate dynamic lighting](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/tag/roguelike/) in a tile-based game.

Emanuele is also a book author: [From null to full HTML5 cross platform game](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2015/06/08/get-my-first-indie-minibook-from-null-to-full-html5-cross-platform-game/). This book covers how to create games using Phaser.

### Phaser Quest

Recently I discovered [Phaser Quest](http://www.dynetisgames.com/2017/03/18/phaser-quest/), a recreation of the game [Browser Quest](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/) but using Phaser as the game engine.

Phaser Quest is totally [open source](https://github.com/Jerenaux/phaserquest) and is quite the complete recreation with assets and levels and multiplayer gameplay.

The author of Phaser Quest is [Jerome Deveaux](https://twitter.com/jerome_renaux) and his [website](http://www.dynetisgames.com/) contains some great posts on how Phaser Quest was developed. I especially liked the recent article on [*interest management for multiplayer games*](http://www.dynetisgames.com/2017/04/05/interest-management-mog/). I wasn't familiar with the topic and the article was great in showing how *interest management* is applied directly to Phaser quest. I like how all the concepts are even tied to concrete code examples.
