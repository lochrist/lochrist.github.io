I made clear that I LOVE to [consume](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-04-24-no-clip) games [postmortems](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-04-27-the-last-game-before-I-die). Recently I found this incredibly interesting list of [10 seminal game postmortems](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/238773/10_seminal_game_postmortems_every_developer_should_read.php) on GamaSutra. And this list is the real deal! All those postmortems are in a written format (no video). And they make for a fine coffee break read if you are currently in vacation like me.

You will find postmortems for these games: original Deus Ex, System Shock 2, Diablo II (that one goes hand to hand with the original Diablo GDC [postmortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VscdPA6sUkc)), Thief, Baldur's Gate, Myth, Unreal Tournament, Age of Empires II, Rainbow 6 and Black and White.

And if this is not enough, GamaSutra has built a HUGE list of all the [postmortems](http://www.gamasutra.com/features/postmortem/) they ever presented.
