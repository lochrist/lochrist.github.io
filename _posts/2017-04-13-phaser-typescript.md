I really like the 2D web game engine [Phaser](http://phaser.io). Its documentation is exceptional. There is an astounding amount of examples (all available [online](http://phaser.io/examples)). And its feature set is great (particle, 3 physics engine, atlas and spritesheet). I also happened to like [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

I then decided to setup a small phaser + typescript [template](https://github.com/lochrist/phaser-vanilla-ts) that would be as simple as possible. No babel, no node modules. Just typescript compiler, its code watcher and requirejs. If you use the [express extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.vscode-express) for VsCode and the VsCode Task Runner, developing is a delight and the build system and deployment doesn't get in your way.

Now if I only could find the drive to create a game!
