I finally got around to setup a blog. Not the easiest thing in the world. My only requirement: it had to support [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for editing. And it needed to be easy to maintain I am not an administrator at heart.

I checked out [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) first. It seemed really nice and easy. But I wasn't ready to pay for it. Never know when my latest fad will die off.

Then I met [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). And learned you could host this maintenance free blogging platform on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Which I didn't know existed! And this is all free to boot!

If only I could find a nice tutorial showing how to set all of things together easily so I finally could start to write. And then I found this [post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Honestly tutorial as good as this one are not always available when you need them.

I wasn't satisfied with the default theming. Then I found that if you host your blog on Github pages you have access to a very limited set of [themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/). I think I picked up the less ugly. [Slate theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate) for the win.

Now if only I could find a way to tag my posts and to display a nice tag view. There didn't seem to be anything out of the box. Except when you can "borrow" from somebody else. I found this nice blog [post](https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/). Let me rephrase this: I find this whole [blog](https://github.com/codinfox/codinfox-lanyon) and I used the tag view stuff and the post aggregate view and called it a day.

The only thing I am not totally satisfied with Jekyll: it seems it doesn't work on Windows. Or that it needs a crazy complicated setup. I guess it will be a good enough reason to get a new Mac!
