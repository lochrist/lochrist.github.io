While searching on twitter for great pixel art, I found this up coming game that is finalizing its kickstarter campaign: [The Iron Oath](http://theironoath.com/) by Curious Panda Games.

The game itself looks really good as it is a mix of tactical rpg *a la* Darkest Dungeon with some great pixel art:

The kickstarter campaign can be found [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/312751524/the-iron-oath-dark-turn-based-tactical-rpg). there is only 3 days to go so make a choice quickly!

The team behind this game is super small: one dev, one artist and one sound designer. The artist ([sennin](http://www.indiedb.com/members/sennin)) was featured recently on [IndieDb](http://www.indiedb.com) for tutorial on how to draw and animate characters in a pixel art game. The tutorial itself is great and full of nicely animated pixels :) I espcially liked the different *steps* in how to make a character come to life:

You can watch a timelapse video of how the character came to be:
