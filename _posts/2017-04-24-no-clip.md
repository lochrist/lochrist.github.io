I like to read and watch any story about game development. Don't get me wrong, I like technical articles as well. But I REALLY like personal stories and post mortem about game making. Creating video games is difficult (in fact delivery any software is difficult) and the personal stories of the people involved in such a creative process are always interesting.

### Books

I read 2 good books recently on story of video games creation:

- [Spelunky (Boos Fight Books 11)](https://www.amazon.ca/Spelunky-Boss-Fight-Books-Book-ebook/dp/B01CYVHYSS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1493064849&sr=1-1&keywords=spelunky): This series of books cover a lot of classic or cult games. This book about the story of Spelunky is super interesting. It is written by the actual author of Spelunly so it has a real personal perspective to it. And it covers a lot of the creative design process clashing with the real world deadline. How feeatures get cuts because of time. How systems that seemed so great on paper are lousy when implemented. And how procedural content generation is the key for some indie game to create long lasting game.
- [Dungeon Hacks](https://www.amazon.ca/Dungeon-Hacks-NetHack-Angband-Roguelikes-ebook/dp/B012QP0Z7O/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1490925377&sr=8-4&keywords=roguelike): a book covering the history of roguelikes from the perennial Rogue, to Angbang and Nethack. It also highlights how all of these games are really community developed and driven and how their evolution is based on all the unpaid hours their maintainers are putting in the games.

### Video

There are a lof of good documentary videos. The most well-known is probably [Indie Game The Movie](http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/). 

GDC Vault is also full of great postmortems. At our office, each Tuesday we watch a "talk". Often these talks are technical about either a new javascript of C features. But sometimes we watch great postmortems. Some of the one we have watch:

- [The Early Days of Id Software](http://gdcvault.com/play/1023765/The-Early-Days-of-id). John Romero narrating the early days of one of the most influential software company of all time. And how they were able to ship 30 games in 3 years!
- [X-COM UFO Defense classic post mortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9XWuVWuzXY&index=17&list=PL2e4mYbwSTbbiX2uwspn0xiYb8_P_cTAr): not the most entertaining presentation but it highlights the long history of the X-COM franchise.
- [Rocket League: the road from cult classic to surprise success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut1BIsCby2c): great talk showcasing how this franchise evolve from fringe player to big success. Not all indie game are smash hit on their first release. Iteration is the key.
- [FTL Postmortem: Designing Without a Pinch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Um97AUqp4): I really like FTL as a game. It is like a scifi [boardgame](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-18-boargames) turned into a semi-turn based [roguelike](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-29-roguelike-development) game with [pixel art](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-13-pixel-art). It really pushes all my buttons! And the presentation is good too. it is amazing what a great game this man team was able to create.
- [Darkest Dungeon: A Design Post-Mortem](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023089/Darkest-Dungeon-A-Design). This talk is behind the GDC vauld paywall but it is really good anyway. It highlights how much grief the developers took from a **maybe** too sensitive community when new changes were pushed on the EARLY ACCESS version of the game! Early access was both a boon and a curse for Red Hook Studio.

### NoClip

I just discovered the [noclip](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fDG3byEcMtbOqPMymDNbw) youtube channel. This channel, is full of video game documentaries! We have added to the *Tuesday Talk Video Queue* 2 new items:

- [Spelunky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv434Xyybqc)
- [The Witness](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fDG3byEcMtbOqPMymDNbw)
