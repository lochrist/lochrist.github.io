I wrote [yesterday](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-04-07-real-game-for-fantasy-console) about the *fantasy console* Pico-8. Little did I know there is already a *fantasy consoles war* going on! This great [article](https://medium.com/@G05P3L/fantasy-console-wars-a-guide-to-the-biggest-playersin-retrogamings-newest-trend-56bbe948474d) by [John King III](https://medium.com/@G05P3L) covers 3 other fantasy consoles.

### TIC-80

The [tic-80](https://nesbox.itch.io/tic) allows higher resolution assets to be used. You can pay whatever you want to access the runtime. All the game editing features are similar to PICO-8: code editor, sprite editor, level editor.

### LIKO-12

The [LIKO-12](https://github.com/RamiLego4Game/LIKO-12/tree/master) has the big advantage of being free and open source. It still uses Lua as it development language and really ressembles the PICO-8 in terms of features.

### Pixel Vision

[Pixel Vision](https://pixelvision8.itch.io/game-creator) is a Fantasy console *generator*. You can define the parameters of your console and build a game for it.

It is based on the open source [Pixel Vision SDK](https://gitlab.com/PixelVision8/SDK) which allows you to build authentic C# 8-bit games. This SDK is really flexible as it integrates with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) and even [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk).

Pixel vision is created by the prolific game development books author [Jesse Freeman](https://twitter.com/jessefreeman) and by pixel artist [Saint11](https://twitter.com/saint11). I already talked about how great Saint11 is at creating Pixel Art [tutorials](https://www.patreon.com/saint11) in a previous [post](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-13-pixel-art).
