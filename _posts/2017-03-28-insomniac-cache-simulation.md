[Insomniac Games](http://www.insomniacgames.com/) has made available his [*Cache simulation*](https://github.com/InsomniacGames/ig-cachesim) library. This is a suite of tools: both runtime data gathering and Review UI that can be used to profile the cache usage of an app running on Windows.

There is even a great [presentation](https://deplinenoise.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/cachesimstyled.pdf) explaining the vision behind this library and how more convenient it is rather than to use another solution like Valgrind.
