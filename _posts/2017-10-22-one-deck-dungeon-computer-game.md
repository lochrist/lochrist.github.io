I have stated my [love](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-22-micro-games) for [One Deck Dungeon](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/179275/one-deck-dungeon) (by [Asmadi Games](http://asmadigames.com/)) [more](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-05-02-one-deck-dungeon-kickstarter) than [once](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-04-02-multi-use-cards). This is a super clever game that mixes risk management, dice puzzle and dungeon crawl. All that in a simple deck of cards! It can be played in a campaign mode in which after each "dungeon delve" you gain experience points that will allow you to buy new skils for your next adventure. I played my first campaign solo and it was super great experience (Warrior for the Win!).

The last few times we played 2 players. And it was a blast. The game itself has a lot of decision points: how do you use your skills, what do you do with your loot (item? XP? skill? potion?) and how do you manage your resources: wounds and time. But I also really like the "dice assignment" part of a turn (i.e how do you defeat the baddy). Most of the time there is an optimal way to defeat the monster (so there is no real decision per se) but HOW to find the best dice allocation is really interesting. Finding the right approach to maximize dice allocation is a zen like puzzle for me. This reminds me on counting points in a cribbage game (I mean this as a big compliment!).

## Computer Game

Lo and behold, I just received a kickstarter [preview email](http://handelabra.com/onedeckdungeon/) announcing that Handelabra Games will create a computer adaptation for One Deck Dungeon! the Kickstarter will be online on November 1st:

The game will be available on Steam. I just hope that they port the game to iPad as it would be a perfect mobile game (especially with the campaign mode).
