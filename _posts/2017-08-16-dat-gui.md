[DatGui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) is a nice library that can be used to embed a property editor in any webapp allowing you to tweaks variables. It can be used to debug an app or to find the right set of settings.

The following [tutorial](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage) is quite good. It highlights all the features of datGui: folders, supports for lots of variables types (number, text, color...), events and constraints. I like how easy it is to use this library.

The following live example:

<iframe src='../examples/datGui/datGui.html' frameborder="0" width='370' height='270'></iframe>

Has been created with this code:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <script src="dat.gui.js"></script>
    <script>
        var FizzyText = function () {
            this.message = 'dat.gui';
            this.speed = 0.8;
            this.displayOutline = false;
            this.explode = function () { alert('Boom!'); };

        };

        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function (event) {
            window.onload = function () {
                var text = new FizzyText();
                var gui = new dat.GUI();
                gui.add(text, 'message');
                gui.add(text, 'speed', -5, 5);
                gui.add(text, 'displayOutline');
                gui.add(text, 'explode');
            };
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

## Other nice libraries:

The site hosting datGui is [Workshop . CHROMEEXPERIMENTS](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/). They develop other nice tools/libraries. Their most well known is arguably [ThreeJs](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) a javascript 3D library.

For those with less depth: [TwoJs](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js/) is a 2D drawing library also developed by ChromeExperiments!
