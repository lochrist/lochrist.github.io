During the last few years I got really fond of Pixel Art. My SNES roots are speaking through this craze. I want to design a game since forever with that aesthetic. I even bought all the packages from
[Oryx Design Lab](http://oryxdesignlab.com/). These bundles of assets (especially the [16 bits one](http://oryxdesignlab.com/products/16-bit-fantasy-tileset)) are really nice. Now if I could only start coding that game...

I thought at some point I could even draw some Pixel Art! This [guy](https://www.patreon.com/saint11) has some SUPER good and illustrated tutorials. Really some of the best informative stuff about 2D drawing I have seen. The latest one is about details in "dungeon ruins".

Amazing how this picture can carry all that information.

I even found a nice Pixel Art editor called [Goya](https://jackschaedler.github.io/goya/).

I stumbled upon this when doing research on und/redo and immutable data structure. This software is a nice piece of tech that uses [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om) a [ClosureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) interface to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I am still not sure I like fully immutable code. Or that I like ClosureScript syntax for that matter. But the editor itself is really well built.

Needless to say I never drew anything worthwhile.
