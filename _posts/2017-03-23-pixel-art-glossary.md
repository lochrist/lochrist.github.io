I already wrote about my fascination with [Pixel Art](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-13-pixel-art). I found this nice [post](http://pixelation.org/index.php?topic=19594) on the excellent [pixelation](http://pixelation.org) web site. This is a massive glossary of all the terms used in Pixel Art with some pretty visual definitions:

### Color Swap

The [Palette Swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_cycling) post is really interesting in showcasing how you can create "animated" water effects just by swapping colors:

Mark Ferrari, one of the main artist on a lot of cult Lucas Films classic games like [Loom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom_(video_game) and [Zak McKracken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_McKracken_and_the_Alien_Mindbenders) has a great [website](http://markferrari.com/art/8bit-game-art/) showing some pretty use of [Color Swap](http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/). His GDC 2016 presentation on [8-bitish graphics](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023586/8-Bit-8-Bitish-Graphics) is really awesome.

### Piskel editor
Last time I wrote about [Goya](https://github.com/jackschaedler/goya) which was really interesting for me because it is built using *functional programming*. Another really great pixel art editor is [piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/). It is also a Web based editor that is [open source](https://github.com/juliandescottes/piskel). You can store your own gallery of drawings and export animations to gif.

This editor is built using useful third party libraries:

- [Gif.js](http://jnordberg.github.io/gif.js/): creates your own gif from still images.
- [Spectrum](https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum) a great color picker that is super [customizable](http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/).
