We are a smallish team of about 30 developers working on Stingray. We have multiple teams spread over Stockholm, Montreal, Paris, San Francisco and Prague. This makes it a bit more complicated to have good communication and synergy.

### How to build a remote team

Last year, when I attended GDC, I had 30 minutes to kill after lunch. Why not go to this presentation on [Remote Team management](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023288/How-to-Build-a-Remote)? I am glad I went to see this! This talk was a real eye opener for multiple reasons:

- This studio only hires people to work remote and make it work properly.
- They force all developers to work on the same core hours to help with communication (you have to like Pacific time!)
- They use Slack with a slew of channels. And they have created channels just to blow off steam: to talk about their weekend, share pictures of their hobbies.
- They use Ventrilo with lots of "virtual chat room" as well. And they try to talk to each other often.

Some more mundane and less relevant remarks on that talk:

- Not all good talk are one hour long (this one is only 30min)!
- The subject seemed a bit boring at first, but the whole gig was really captivating. A good presenter can make anything sounds interesting.

### How is it at Trello

This [article](http://blog.trello.com/6-mistakes-when-you-work-in-office-but-have-remote-team-members) was posted recently and highlight some of the key rules the Trello team found to make their "remote collaboration works". Some key points for me were:

- *Avoid impromptu design meetings and decisions*: it is easy to talk to your co-located colleagues and take a big decision (let's create a global event service). And it is easy to communicate that decisions to the rest of your remote team 2 weeks after with a Pull Request without some big explanation. And 2 months down the road someone will reinvent the same *event service* because they didn't know about it.
- *Use video calls. And ensure eveyrone has a camera*: I hate remote meetings with a passion. But it seems having meetings with everbody on camera helps connecting with my remote colleagues and makes communication easier. It also helps humanize those people who put comments on your pull requests :)
