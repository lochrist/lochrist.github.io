What happens when you mix the three great tastes that are: [Roguelikes](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-29-roguelike-development), [Pixel Art](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-13-pixel-art) and [Physics Simulation](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-06-17-physics-simulation-programming)? A game called [Noita](http://noitagame.com/) is born!

This pixel art roguelike is built on a custom engine called "[Falling Everything](http://nollagames.com/fallingeverything/)". This engine allows the physical simulation of ALL pixels in the game accordinging to a set of chemical and physical properties. If you look at the trailer you see gases, liquid (different liqui with different properties), particles, sand *stuff*, rigid body, projectile. The whole game is procedural and all of its environment is simulated.

I like how the devs describe their engine when asked : How are you able to simulate so much stuff?

> We're using our own Falling Everything engine. Falling Everything Engine is an in-house labor of love. A true love child. Handcrafted in the finest C++ without exceptions, using only hand picked, organic, free license libraries. 

Be sure to check the the release date of that game which should happen somewhere in 201X (how precise)!
