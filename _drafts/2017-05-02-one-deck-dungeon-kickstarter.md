I wrote [abundantly](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-03-22-micro-games) on how [One Deck Dungeon](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/179275/one-deck-dungeon) is a [great game](https://lochrist.github.io/blog/2017-04-02-multi-use-cards). This super elegant *Roguelike card and dice game* is back on Kickstarter for a standalone expansion: [Forest of Shadows](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/asmadigames/one-deck-dungeon-forest-of-shadows).

This is your chance to back this great game to experience both the cleverness of the muti-use cards:

As well as the campaign system. The game comes with all new heroes, dungeons and rules update. I can't wait to get my hand on a copy!
