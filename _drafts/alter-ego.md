I like both american style comic books and european graphic novel. One of the more interesting graphic novels I read in a long time is the [Alter Ego](https://www.comixology.com/Alter-Ego/comics-series/78828?ref=c2VhcmNoL2luZGV4L2Rlc2t0b3Avc2xpZGVyTGlzdC9zZXJpZXNTbGlkZXI) serie.

It is a kind of urban scifi serie with great art style and a great story that I can't talk about because... what is fascinating with these books is that you can read the first 6 episodes in ANY order! And then you read the last [one](https://www.amazon.com/Alter-Ego-Cycle-Ultimatum-Saison-ebook/dp/B01GZZNXCA).

Some book will tell you more about the main plot while in others the characters are only peripheral to the crux of the story. Depending on the order you read the books a sort of "alternative narrative" happens. You won't have the same feeling for the story than one of your friend who has read the books in a different order! It will make your experience unique in that regards. It is rare to have books being so "chaotic" in terms of storytelling.
