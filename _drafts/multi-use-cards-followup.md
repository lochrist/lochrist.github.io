I recently listened to [episode 145](http://ludology.libsyn.com/ludology-episode-145-six-ways-from-sunday) of the [Ludology](http://www.ludology.libsyn.com/) podcast. That episode covered *multi-use cards* in games. This episode reminded me of a lot of good card games I totally forgot to talk about when I wrote about [multi-use cards recently].

### The Precursor
The first game to make multi-use of cards is [Up Front](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/586/front). This is a 1983 published games about World War II that is currently out of print. This game was really innovative, it was using its card for characters, terrain and actions.

### A Cold War game

[Twilight Struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Struggle) is a card driven 2 players game about the Cold War. Each cards has an Influence value and an Event and you can play your card using any of those 2 abilities.

What is really nice with that game is how easy it is to have access to it: there is the analog version that got reprinted but you can also buy it on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/406290/), [iOs](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/twilight-struggle/id942766453?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdekgames.twilightstruggle&hl=en).
