I recently listened to [episode 145](http://ludology.libsyn.com/ludology-episode-145-six-ways-from-sunday) of the [Ludology](http://www.ludology.libsyn.com/) podcast. That episode covered *multi-use cards* in games. This episode reminded me of a lot of good card games I totally forgot to talk about when I wrote about [multi-use cards recently].

### The Precursor
The first game to make multi-use of cards is [Up Front](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/586/front). This is a 1983 published games about World War II that is currently out of print. This game was really innovative, it was using its card for characters, terrain and actions.

### A Cold War game

[Twilight Struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Struggle) is a card driven 2 players game about the Cold War. Each cards has an Influence value and an Event and you can play your card using any of those 2 abilities.

What is really nice with that game is how easy it is to have access to it: there is the analog version that got reprinted but you can also buy it on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/406290/), [iOs](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/twilight-struggle/id942766453?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdekgames.twilightstruggle&hl=en).

### Valey of the Kings
[Dominion](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) has created its own category of card games. While most deckbuilders have one use for their cards (in Dominion cards are either Money, Victory Point or Action) Valley of the Kings applied its own tweak on the genre. Each cards in Valley of the Kings is both Money and Action. And effects scale with the power level of the card. The more powerful an action, the more gold this card give you. It creates a nice tension: do you spend the card for good money or do you keep it for its action?

Apart from this, Valley of the Kings is a really clever and under appreciated card game. It is inexpensive, compact, it has an uncommon theme (populate your Egyptian Tomb!) and the *Entomb* mecanism is super well integrated. In order to score points from a card, you have to *Entomb* it and remove it from your deck. You need to gauge how many use of a powerful card is enough before cashing it. Also, what is not to like about the card offer being shape like a pyramid that crumble when you buy a card from its base? :)

### Imperial Settlers and 51st State
This clever and really brain burny card game has first started with [51st State](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/73369/51st-state). The theme was post apocalyptic, with factions made out of Mutants, Traders, New Yorkers and Appalachians! All the cards could be use in multiple way: you can Raze it to gain its resource once, you can sign a "contract" with the card to get some small amount of resources each turn, or you can conquer the card an atach it to your Home Base to benefits from its skill.

The iconography is a bit heavy but the game is really thematic and strategic. 

[Imperial Settlers](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154203/imperial-settlers) is the family friendly version of the same engine. You play as either the Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians or Japanese and you play your card in a similar way (Raze, Contract or Conquer) trying to get a better victory point engine than your neighboor.

The cards have a bit more text but it makes for a clearer design in my opinion.
