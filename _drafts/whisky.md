The name of the blog is *Tech, Games and Whisky*. I have talked plenty about games and techs. But never about whisky. And I am about to correct that!

I really like whisky. I like to taste, I like to buy and to collect all kinds of whisky. Single malts, blend, bourbon or any other king of whisky for that matter.

I even bought my own ["neutral alcool" big bottle](http://subversifs.ca/lessubversifs/chien_blanc.php?lang=fr) and a small barrel and aged some whisky like concoction myself.

### Lots of Smoke

I like whiskies with lots of taste. I like whiskies that are off the chart on the taste map:

Two of my favorite really smoky whiskies are the Ardbeg:

and (obviously) Lagavulin:

The latter has a iodine taste that is like no other.

### And some peat

The next 2 whiskies I like are really *controversials*. As much as whisky can be controversial anyway... Their tastes are so unbalanced that a lot of people do not like them. Their names says all that needs to be known about their defining characteristic.

Big Peat:

And the Peat Monster:

### Pure Canadian Rye

I am canadian, and it seems Canada as a reputation for Rye whisky. I like that good Ryes are super smooth (contrary to the Peat brothers above) and that even non-whisky aficiado can appreciate them.

Lot 40 is a really cheap and great rye. They have gone back to their ancestral recipe and it is now a 100% Rye drink (which wasn't always the case).

Royal crown produces a LOT of whisky. I will admit that I find a lot of them a bit bland for my taste but one of their latest batch: the Rye Harvest is really interesting. This is a Rye with a lot of flavor that has won a lot of prizes.

### New in the family

As of yesterday, I am back from a London trip. I had the chance to go to the [Whisky Shop](), a great whisky shop near Buckingham palace. I tried to find a product I wouldn't be able to get in Canada and I think I struck gold: The Glendronach Allardice 18 years. This small distillery doesn't export a lot of bottle and the quality of their product is outstanding. As the vendor would say to me: if Macallan would sell the same stuff it would be 200Â£!
