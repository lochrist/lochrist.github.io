I have been a manager on Stingray for the past year. It happened quite organically and never was planned on my part. In fact I did not want at all to become manager. But at some point we had choice between bringing someone from outside of Stingray who didn't know a thing about our techs... or for me to step up and manage the Tools team. We have chosen the latter. Since that time I try to juggle what I like to do: code and be involved with technology with managing responsabilities.

## One-on-one meetings

Recently I had to do one-on-one review for my team. A rather awkward experience for all parties involved! I wish I had found this great [article](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/how-to-have-an-honest-one-on-one-with-an-employee-6b918e5662bb) by [Claire Yew](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/@cjlew23) before. She gives 6 tips to improve communication with your team members:

> - Make empathy your mission.
> - Ask questions to uncover two things: tension and energy.
> - Admit what you think you suck at.
> - Explain why you need their input.
> - Don’t get defensive.
> - Talk less.

The whole article is well worth a read. And a reread for my particular case. I will try to improve for next year meetings.


## Questions to ask your employees

The ever prolific Claire Yew has published another great [piece](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-9-questions-that-uncover-the-most-surprising-insights-from-employees-b7bc0d20ede8) about what to ask your employees to learn **a lot** about what they think about their work (and life and such). These nine questions are sure to stir the pot and create great and *informative* discussions.

> - Are you afraid of anything at work?
> - Have you seen something recently and thought to yourself ‘I wish we’d done that’
> - Is there something we should measure in the company that we currently don’t?
> - Is there any part of the company you wish you were able to interact with more?
> - Are there any benefits we don’t offer that you’d like to see us offer?
> - Is there an area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?
> - Is there anyone at the company you wish you could apprentice under for a few weeks?
> - Have you seen someone here do great work that’s gone unnoticed?
> - Are there things you don’t know about the company that you feel you should know?

All of these questions have been asked to a lot of actual employees and the article goes in great details at explaining what surprises these questions have dig up.
