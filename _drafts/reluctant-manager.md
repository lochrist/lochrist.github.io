I have been a manager on Stingray for the past year. It happened quite organically and never was planned on my part. In fact I did not want at all to become manager. But at some point we had choice between bringing someone from outside of Stingray who didn't know a thing about our techs... or for me to step up and manage the Tools team. We have chosen the latter. Since that time I try to juggle what I like to do: code and be involved with technology with managing responsabilities.

Recently I had to do one-on-one review for my team. A rather awkward experience for all parties involved! I wish I had found this great [article](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/how-to-have-an-honest-one-on-one-with-an-employee-6b918e5662bb) by [Claire Yew](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/@cjlew23) before. She gives 6 tips to improve communication with your team members:

> - Make empathy your mission.
> - Ask questions to uncover two things: tension and energy.
> - Admit what you think you suck at.
> - Explain why you need their input.
> - Donâ€™t get defensive.
> - Talk less.

The whole article is well worth a read. And a reread for my particular case. I will try to improve for next year meetings.
